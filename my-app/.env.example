# Auth0 Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your Auth0 credentials

VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-tenant.us.auth0.com

# Note: For Single Page Applications (SPAs), the Client ID is public
# and safe to include in your code. Security is enforced through
# Auth0's application configuration (allowed callback URLs, etc.)
